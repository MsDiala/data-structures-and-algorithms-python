 # Stacks and Queues

 we created a data structure called **Stack** and **Queue** in Python. We used three classes, _Node_ and _Queue_, and _Stack_.
 
 ### Challenge
- Write queue and stack classes with their methods

## Approach & Efficiency
Stack :
- Define a method called push 
- Define a method called pop 
- Define a method called peek 

Queue:
- Define a method called enqueue
- Define a method called dequeue
- Define a method called peek big
