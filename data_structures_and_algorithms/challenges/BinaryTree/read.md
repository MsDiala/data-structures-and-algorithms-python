# code challenge 17

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. 
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, 
traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, 
and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

# Algorithm 
1- visit the root of the tree and print it 

2- if the root have childes print the childe on the left then on the right 

3- go to the level below and repeat the above for each node 
              1
          2      3
       9     5 6    7
